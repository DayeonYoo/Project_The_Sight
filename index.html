    <h1>Project: The Sight</h1>
    <p>This project is a virtual exhibition about people's sight. <br>
      People's sight sometimes could be somewhat voyeuristic or hinders other people. <br>
      Inspired by some movies of Alfred Hitchcock, artworks, and games.<br></p>
    <p>
      <h3>Voyeurism</h3>

    <p><i>Click. Who is watching who?</i>
            <p>
        <p>Inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's motif of voyeurism and birds, particularly from <i>Psycho</i>(1960), <i>The Bird</i>(1963).</p>

    <p><i>Click and drag a walking person, eyes will always follow you.</i></p>
  <p>
    <p>"<i>Gazes</i>" is a part of my previous stop motion art video titled <i>Infected, Affected, Effected</i>, which explores the psychological phenomenon of the COVID-19 period.<br>
  In 2020, during a few days of isolation in the facility and two weeks of self-quarantine, I had experienced being controlled freedom, the fear of infection, and negative public opinion about locals from foreign countries at that time. <br>
  I extended those experiences of anxiety through the abstract atmosphere of stop motion animation using linocuts, collagraphs, and monographs, <br>
  furthermore, made a simple interactive scene using p5js.</p>
