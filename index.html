    <h1>Project: The Sight</h1>
    <p>This project is a virtual exhibition about people's sight. <br>
      People's sight sometimes could be somewhat voyeuristic or hinders other people. <br>
      Inspired by some movies of Alfred Hitchcock, artworks, and games.<br>
      I tried to combine rigorous geometric elements from programming with the aesthetic touch of visual art.<br></p>

      <h2>Voyeurism</h2>

    <p><i>Click. Who is watching who?</i>
            <p>
        <p>Inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's motif of voyeurism and birds, particularly from <i>Psycho</i> (1960), <i>The Bird</i> (1963).</p>

      <p><i>The eye is glimpsing a person, but as you know, it is not polite to keep staring at someone.</i></p>

    <h2>Gazes</h2>
      <p>
      <a href="https://dayeonyoo.github.io/Gazes/" target="_blank"><img src="https://assets.editor.p5js.org/601421a03c3a22002483e2ef/849942f8-88e0-49d8-87e4-ee8139bd6a53.gif"width=100 height=150></a>
    <p><i>Click and drag a walking person, eyes will always follow you.</i></p>
  <p>
    <p>"<i>Gazes</i>" is a part of my previous stop motion art video titled <i>Infected, Affected, Effected</i>, which explores the psychological phenomenon of the COVID-19 period.<br>
  In 2020, during a few days of isolation in the facility and two weeks of self-quarantine, I had experienced being controlled freedom, the fear of infection, and negative public opinion about locals from foreign countries at that time. <br>
  I extended those experiences of anxiety through the abstract atmosphere of stop motion animation using linocuts, collagraphs, and monographs, <br>
  furthermore, made a simple interactive scene using p5js.</p>

    <h2>Rear Window</h2>

    <p>
      <p><i>Click and watch each person living their life. Someday, they will notice you are watching them.</i></p> 
        <p>
      <p><i>Rear Window</i>, as a title, this project is created as an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Rear Window</i> (1954).<br>
    The project is inspired by the movie <i>Rear Window</i>, but I shift a bit more modernistic and reflect the COVID-19 period.<br>
        Each floor has a different story, <br>
        which the top floor of the apartment symbolizes disconnection, <br>
        the middle one is about loneliness (Miss. LonelyHearts), <br>
        and the bottom floor is about the aggression of the relationship.
